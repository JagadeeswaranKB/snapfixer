    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="lead">At SnapFixer, we take your privacy extremely seriously. We operate on a "zero-knowledge" basis
        wherever possible.</p>

    <h3>1. Image Processing</h3>
    <p>When you upload a photo to SnapFixer, it is processed either directly in your browser or on our secure,
        ephemeral servers.
        <strong>We do not permanently store your photos.</strong> Once your passport photo is generated and downloaded,
        the original and processed files are automatically deleted from our system within minutes.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Data Collection</h3>
    <p>We do not collect personal identification information (PII) such as your name, address, or phone number unless
        you voluntarily provide it (e.g., via our contact form). We may collect anonymous usage statistics to improve
        our service.</p>

    <h3>3. Cookies and Advertising</h3>
    <p>We use local storage technology to save your preferences (such as your last selected country) to enhance your
        user experience.</p>
    <p>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website (e.g., Google AdSense).
        These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide
        advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Specifically, Google's use of advertising cookies
        enables it and its partners to serve ads to you based on your visit to this site and/or other sites on the
        Internet.</p>
    <p>Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ads Settings</a>.</p>

        Policy on this page.</p>
